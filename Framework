Introduction and Whole process
  1. Introduction page (team members)
  
  2. What are we doing and why? (combining cloud computing techniques with trading algorithm, 
    enabling high frequency trading and flexible changing strategies)
    
  3. algo lifecycle? 
    Stock pool - Selection criteria - Algorithm design - Backtesting - Real-time simulation - Algo Trading
  
  4. Techniques enablers
    Zipline, Yahoo finance API, EC2(m3largex2?), HFT - Bloomberg API(only 140 days of intraday data)

Data Overview and Pre-treatment
  5. Dataset (streaming data from Yahoo finance API, scale - 6 fields * 8177 days * 502 stocks)
    use "Adj closing price" to do pre-treatment and selection
    stock pool
    
  6. Algo overview
    a. dual moving average(fundamental) - how it works: trends
    selection criteria - high volatility - high std, good sharp ratio
    
  7. the computation and result for algo a.
  
  8.b. spread trading(fundamental) - how it works: mean reversion
    selection criteria - high correlation
    
  9. the computation and result for algo b.

Algo a.
  10. Algo parameters selection, and when should it be triggered
  
  11. Order results (when it was triggered)
  
  12. Portfolio graph, how much profits
  
  13. capital requirements (only part of 100k are used), percentage profits
  
  14. what could be done to improve profits or algorithm
  
Algo b.
  15. Algo parameters selection, and when should it be triggered
  
  16. Order results (when it was triggered)
  
  17. Portfolio graph, how much profits
  
  18. capital requirements (only part of 100k are used), percentage profits
  
  19. what could be done to improve profits or algorithm

Conclusion
  20. Key learning points and future developments
